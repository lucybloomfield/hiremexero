    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 handwritten">Before I start any kind of marketing, the first place I go to and work on is the point of conversion - the website. There's often more than enough traffic going to a website to achieve the business objective, but issues at certain conversion stages - you can often 2-4x your results just by investing into the site.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium text-black mb-4 handwritten">So let's talk about the Xero Developer Website</h3>

      <li>Changing calls-to-actions to sign up forms to drop # of steps to conversion.</li>
      <li>Resequencing content to match the customer journey — introducing later-stage content (like partner manager benefits) after signup.</li>
      <li>Adding social proof (press logos or customer testimonials) at the top to quickly build trust and overcome objections.</li>
      <li>Elevating strong brand stories to enhance relatability.</li>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium text-black mb-4 handwritten">1. I Build Strategy That Drives Measurable Outcomes</h3>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 handwritten">You don’t just need more marketing—you need marketing that moves the needle. I’ve helped over 200 businesses scale from zero to thousands of customers by building strategic campaign frameworks that generate results without needing big budgets.</p>
    <!-- Diagram Container -->
    <div class="diagram-container bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg border mb-12">
      <p>When I look at marketing, I don't see social media posts or email marketing or Facebook Ads - I see a system with vats that need more eyeballs, and machinery that needs to be optimised to produce the most efficient "product" - aka conversions for the company.</p>
      <img src="src/img/marketing-diagram.png" alt="My marketing process" class="w-full h-auto">
    </div>
    


    <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium text-black mb-4 handwritten">2. I Speak Developer, But I Think Business</h3>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 handwritten">My strength lies in bridging worlds—technical and commercial. From running my own SaaS company to consulting on high-conversion strategies, I’ve developed a knack for translating developer needs into business goals and vice versa.</p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 handwritten">That means I don’t just make pretty landing pages—I build ecosystems that serve both your internal teams and your community of developers.</p>  
    <!-- Diagram Container -->
    <div class="diagram-container bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg border mb-12">
      <p>What initially caught my attention with the Senior Developer Marketing Manager job descripton was the unique opportunity to blend the technical, with business, with marketing. If I could summarise the last ten years of my career, that's all I've been doing.</p>

    </div>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium text-black mb-4 handwritten">3. I Build, Then Scale</h3>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 handwritten">I don't just create plans—I bring them to life with practical execution and a relentless focus on impact. Whether it's designing a developer marketing campaign from scratch, operationalising content engines, or building internal processes that empower teams to move faster, I focus on creating real, tangible outcomes.</p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 handwritten">Once something’s working, I systemise it, scale it, and move on to the next opportunity. I bring a rare mix of strategic vision and hands-on execution, making me the kind of leader who doesn't just talk about growth — I architect it, test it, refine it, and drive it forward.</p>

    <!-- Diagram Container -->
    <div class="diagram-container bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg border mb-12">
      <p>I'm agnostic when it comes to marketing tactics - influencer marketing? social media? emails? ads? Like, use and rely on them all... if they perform and continue to perform over time, at scale.</p>
      <p>My initial run on any marketing efforts is about as many tests as possible, then moving based off what the data says from there - it's all about what's most cost-effective and results-effective.</p>
