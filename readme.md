README: Xero Hiring Team

(Let’s Build Something Amazing Together... With a Side of SAAS)

Hey Xero Hiring Team! 👨‍💻👩‍💻

First off, congratulations! You’ve just discovered the most entertaining README you’ll read today—probably this week, maybe even this month. Grab your coffee, sit back, and let me tell you why I’m the Senior Developer Marketing Manager you didn’t know you needed (but now absolutely do).

Why I’m the Senior Developer Marketing Manager You’ve Been Waiting For

Marketing Meets Development Like Peanut Butter Meets Jelly
You’re looking for someone who can bridge the gap between development and marketing, right? Well, guess what? I’m the glue. I’ve spent years in both worlds, speaking the language of developers and marketers alike. Whether it’s designing landing pages that convert or making sure the code behind those pages is just as optimized, I’m your go-to person. SEO? I’m already thinking about it while I’m coding. Marketing campaigns? Let me code up some automation to take that off your plate.

Tech Savvy, Marketing Smart
I know my way around a tech stack like nobody’s business, and I use that to fuel my marketing strategies. From crafting user-friendly features to analyzing user data, I’m constantly improving the customer journey, whether that’s via seamless UX/UI design or killer content strategy. Full-stack marketer, meet full-stack developer. I do both and make them work together.

Agile Marketing, Agile Development
I live and breathe Agile—whether it’s sprint planning for marketing or development, I know how to move fast without breaking things (except bugs, those are meant to be broken). I can pivot in real-time, test and iterate, and consistently deliver results. Deadlines? I laugh in their face (okay, maybe I cry a little, but then I crush them).

Analytics Overload, but in the Best Way
If data is your best friend, then consider me the person who knows how to invite it to the party. From Google Analytics to A/B testing, I’m all about understanding user behavior and tweaking campaigns and code to squeeze out maximum ROI. Marketing without data is like coding without debugging—just plain wrong.

A Little Humor Goes a Long Way
I believe that humor is the secret sauce to any successful team. After all, we can’t just be about numbers, stats, and KPIs—we need to laugh along the way. If I’m not in a sprint meeting talking about KPIs, I’m probably cracking a joke about the latest marketing trend or the time I broke the codebase while trying to add a feature to the product page. (Okay, that last one was just once, and I swore I’d never tell anyone.)

What I Bring to the Table (Besides Code and Campaigns)
Experience: 7+ years of mastering the art of marketing and development. Whether it's building scalable applications or crafting hyper-targeted marketing campaigns, I’ve done it all.

Tools of the Trade: JavaScript, Python, Angular, Node.js, React, Google Ads, HubSpot, SEO tools, and so much more—let’s just say I’m well-versed in all things digital.

Marketing Savvy: I know how to translate complex tech into compelling marketing strategies. I don’t just write content—I optimize it for conversions.

Leadership and Teamwork: Leading projects, mentoring teams, or collaborating with cross-functional departments is where I shine. Your marketing and dev teams will feel like a unified force of nature.

Problem Solving: Whether it’s an SEO issue or a development bottleneck, I’m all about creating solutions that not only work but work well.

The TL;DR (But Seriously, Keep Reading)
I’m not just a Senior Developer Marketing Manager—I’m the bridge between your marketing goals and your tech development. I optimize code for better marketing outcomes, build scalable features that actually help your campaigns, and always keep user experience top of mind.

Let’s create something beautiful, efficient, and effective. Together, we can make marketing tech magic happen at Xero!

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards (and no, I don’t charge for my puns),
Lucy Bloomfield

P.S. If you didn’t laugh at least once, don’t worry. I code better than I joke!
